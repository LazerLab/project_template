# Project template

A simple template for research project repos.

The template contains the following directories:

1. `data` for raw & derived datasets
1. `libs` for libraries for the project
1. `notebooks` for (timestamped) experiment notebooks
1. `workflow` for workflow files and scripts
1. `.gitignore` for temporary and binary files to be ignored by git (LaTeX, Python, Jupyter, data files, etc.)
